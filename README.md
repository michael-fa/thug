I use this as reference for own modification-projects and I do not plan and pushing anything here. 
Either way I may publish some code that will have great usage for others, right now I spent more then 2 months (april - june) looking
inside gamefile / process and could fasten it up HIGHLY by using this.

Tho I did not publish anything, I made some internal progress with my modloader-api.

It appears that there's a command line scripting qb gernally loaded by actv. dev Mike.
He uses this for debugging purposes.
